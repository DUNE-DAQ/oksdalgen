# oksdalgen

This package is a DUNE DAQ repurposing of the oksdalgen package from
the ATLAS TDAQ, featuring the `oksdalgen` app. In general you'll never
need to use this as it's wrapped by the `daq_oks_codegen` function
found in daq-cmake; if, however, you're curious about it you can learn
more by running `oksdalgen -h`.

For documentation on `daq_oks_codegen`, please take a look at the
[daq-cmake
documentation](https://dune-daq-sw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/daq-cmake/).
